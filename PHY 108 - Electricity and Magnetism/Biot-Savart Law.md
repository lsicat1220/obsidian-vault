When there is a [current](Electric%20Current.md) running through a wire, it creates a [Magnetic Field](magnetic%20field.md) everywhere around it. At a certain spot a distance $r$ away from the wire, every infinitesimal length of wire contribute to a magnetic field there:

$$
d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{i d\vec{s} \times \hat{r}}{r^2}
$$

or in scalar form:

$$
d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{i d\vec{s} \sin(\theta)}{r^2}
$$

The unit vector points from the infinitesimal length of wire to the spot in question, meaning that for a wire that points into the page, the magnetic field lines move circularly around the wire clockwise.

After integrating this equation for an infinite length of wire going both ways, the magnetic field at a distance R from the wire comes out to be

$$
B= \frac{\mu_0i}{2\pi R}
$$

or half that when the wire is semi-infinite.
