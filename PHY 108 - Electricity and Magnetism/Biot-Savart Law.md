When there is a [[Electric Current|current]] running through a wire, it creates a [[magnetic field]] at a spot, where all infinitesimal segments $d\vec{s}$ contribute:

$$
d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{i d\vec{s} \times \hat{r}}{r^2}
$$

or in scalar form:

$$
d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{i d\vec{s} \sin(\theta)}{r^2}
$$

After integrating this equation for an infinite length of wire going both ways, the magnetic field at a distance R from the wire comes out to be

$$
B= \frac{\mu_0i}{2\pi R}
$$

or half that when the wire is semi-infinite.
