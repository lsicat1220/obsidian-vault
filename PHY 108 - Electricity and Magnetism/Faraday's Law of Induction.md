Faraday's Law of Induction states that an [[electric current]] in a [[Circuits|circuit]] may be induced by a changing [[magnetic field]]. 

This law makes use of the concept of magnetic flux, which is defined as the amount of magnetic field passing through a surface, most commonly a loop.

$$
\Phi_B = \int \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A}
$$
This value is called a weber, abbreviated as Wb.

Using the magnetic flux, we may formally write Faraday's law by stating that the induced [[Electromotive Force|emf]] in a circuit by a changing magnetic field is rate of change of the magnetic flux over time.

$$
\xi = - \frac{d\Phi_b}{dt}
$$
To find the magnetic flux through a coil of N turns, we simply multiply this equation by N.
