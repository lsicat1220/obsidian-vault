Ampere's Law states that the [Magnetic Field](magnetic%20field.md) through a closed loop (Amperian loop) is proportional to the enclosed [current](Electric%20Current.md) in that loop.

$$
\oint \vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s} = \mu_0 i_{enc}
$$

Similar to [Gauss's Law](Gauss's%20Law.md), we may find the magnetic field anywhere in relation to a current if we can use a loop that we know will have a constant magnetic field tangent to its curve. 

For example, for one straight wire, we can determine that the magnetic field is constant in a circle around it and perpendicular to the line, so we may write:

$$
\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{s} = \vec{B} \oint\vec{s} = B(2\pi r)
$$
With this, we can solve for the magnetic field.

$$
B = \frac{\mu_0 i}{2 \pi r}
$$
