When a particle exists in space, it will exert a [[force]] on any other particle around it proportional to its [[electric charge]], given by 
$$
\vec{F}=k\cdot{}\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}
$$
To generalize this to any given particle or set of particles, we can take a test particle of charge $q=1C$ and find the force that is exerted on that particle at any given point. 
$$
\vec{F}=k\cdot{}\frac{(1C)q_2}{r^2}
$$
If we divide the force by the charge of the particle (still one) we will get a number that we can multiply by any charge to find the force exerted on that charge. This is known as the electric field at that point, given in newtons per coulomb (N/C). 
$$
\vec{E}=k\cdot{}\frac{q}{r^2}
$$
If there is a charged particle anywhere in space, there will be an electric field everywhere around it. For any charge, the force on it from the electric field would be:
$$
\vec{F}=q\cdot{}\vec{E}
$$
The electric field may also be represented in terms of [[Electric Potential|voltage]]. Voltage can be expressed as
$$
\Delta V=-\int_{r_1}^{r_2}\vec{E} \cdot dr
$$
so it follows that electric field is gradient (rate of change) of the voltage at a certain point, or 
$$
\vec{E} = -\frac{dV}{dr}
$$
