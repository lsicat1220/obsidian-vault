An electric circuit is a path through which charge can flow, involving a wire of [[Conductors|conducting material]], a battery, and other components through which [[electric current]] can flow. 

When a wire is attached in a loop to the two terminals of a battery, the battery creates and maintains a [[electric potential|potential difference]] between its terminals by taking electrons on one side and putting them on the other, causing the electrons in the wire to move to cancel the external [[electric field]]. Since the battery prevents equilibrium, electrons don't stop moving until the battery can no longer maintain the potential difference.
