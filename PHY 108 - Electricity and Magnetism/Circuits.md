An electric circuit is a path through which charge can flow, involving a wire of [conducting material](Conductors.md), a battery, and other components through which [Electric Current](electric%20current.md) can flow. 

When a wire is attached in a loop to the two terminals of a battery, the battery creates and maintains a [potential difference](electric%20potential.md) between its terminals by taking electrons on one side and putting them on the other, causing the electrons in the wire to move to cancel the external [Electric Field](electric%20field.md). Since the battery prevents equilibrium, electrons don't stop moving until the battery can no longer maintain the potential difference. 

The current of the circuit depends on the voltage of the battery and the [Resistance](resistance.md) of the wire. The relationship between these values is known as Ohm's Law, and goes as follows:

$$
V = IR
