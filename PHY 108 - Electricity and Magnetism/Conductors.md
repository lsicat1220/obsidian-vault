Conductors are materials, such as most metals, that allow electric charge to flow through them easily. In other words, the electrons inside them are free to move around inside the material. 

When a conductor is subject to an [Electric Field](electric%20field.md), the internal electrons will rearrange so as to cancel out the outside electric field inside. As such, the conductor will have no [potential difference](electric%20potential%20) inside and become an equipotential.
