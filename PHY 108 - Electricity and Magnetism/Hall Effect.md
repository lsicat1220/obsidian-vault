When a [[Conductors|conductor]] carrying a [[Electric Current|current]] is placed in a uniform [[Magnetic Field]], the moving electrons will eventually be pulled to some direction due to the magnetic field. This leads to an imbalance in charge within the conductor that only stops growing once the internal voltage matches that of the magnetic force. 

This voltage, which is constant, is called the Hall voltage. Using this voltage $V$, we can determine the number density of charge carriers in a given conductor:

$$
n = \frac{Bi}{Vle}
$$
where l is the perpendicular measurement to the current and magnetic field, often called thickness, where height is the length along the Hall voltage and width is along the current.

When a conductor moves through a uniform magnetic field, the electrons will move as if there was a current. Since the magnetic field is now in terms of the conductors speed, we can write the internal potential difference as the following: 

$$
V=vBd
$$
