Electric current is the rate at which charge passes through a space, expressed in amperes, or coulombs per second ($I$),

$$
I = \frac{dq}{dt}
$$

The velocity of all electrons in a current can be averaged out to get the drift velocity $v_s$. If we take q to be the number of electrons in a given volume times its charge and t to be the length of that volume divided by its drift velocity, we come to the following equation:

$$
i = \frac{q}{t} = \frac{nALe}{L/v_d} = nAev_d
$$
