For any given [[electric field]], there is [[energy]]. To place a [[Electric Charge|charge]] anywhere next to another charge, you must do some work to bring it there, since charges will always exert forces on each other. 

Conventionally, we consider the force on a charge from another to be 0 only when it is infinitely far away, so the work that the electric puts on the charge as we bring a charge from infinity to some distance R away from another particle is represented by the following function:
$$
W_{electric field}=\int_{\infty}^R k\cdot \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}dr \Rightarrow -k\cdot \frac{q_1q_2}{R}
$$
The work that the charge does on our charge is stored as potential energy between the two charges, just as gravity does work on an object and puts it in gravitational potential energy when you lift it. 

We can generalize this to any given charge by dividing the work done to get to place near another charge by a test charge. This new quality, the joules per coulomb in an electric field, is called *electric potential*, and is represented in volts (V).
$$
V=k\cdot \frac{q}{r}
$$
When you go from one place to another, in an electric field, you must do work. Thanks to the properties of integrals, we can find this by simply subtracting the initial voltage from the final voltage.

The voltage, or potential difference of two points in an electric field may be obtained using the following line integral. 
$$
\Delta V = -\int_{r_1}^{r_2} \vec{E} \cdot dr
$$
The integral is negative because if a test charge (positive) went in the direction of the electric field, its potential would decrease (the electric field is helping it move).
