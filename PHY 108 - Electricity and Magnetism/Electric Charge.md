Every particle has some charge $q$. This charge is measured in coulombs ($C$) or the charge of 6.24 quintillion electrons ($6.24\cdot{}10^{18}e$). If there are two charges in space, they will exert a equal and opposite [[force]] on each other that is equal to the following equation:


$$
\vec{F}=k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}
$$

where $\vec{F}$ points away from the other particle. This is equation is known as Coulomb's Law. 


Particles can have a negative charge or a positive charge, like protons and electrons. As you might infer, if a charge is negative and the other is positive, the two are attracted to another, while if they have the same sign, they repel.
