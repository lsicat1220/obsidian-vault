Every particle has some charge $q$. This charge is measured in coulombs ($C$) or the charge of 6.24 quintillion electrons ($6.24\cdot{}10^{18}e$). If there are two charges in space, they will exert a equal and opposite [[force]] on each other that is equal to the following equation:
$$
\vec{F}=k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}
$$
where $\vec{F}$ points away from the other particle.  

Particles can have a negative charge or a positive charge, like protons and electrons. As you might infer, if a charge is negative and the other is positive, the two are attracted to another, while if they have the same sign, they repel.

Electric charges also produce an [[electric field]], which is a representation of the force it exerts on a proton at any given point in space. 

Electric charges, when subject to an outside electric field, will want to go in the direction of the electric field, depending on the sign of its charge. As such, the force exerted on a charge in an electric field is represented by this function:
$$
\vec{F}=\vec{E}q 
$$
This movement can also be interpreted as charges wanting to move in from places of high [[electric potential]] to places of low electric potential, or in the case of negative particles, from low potential to high potential. When doing so, the charge gains kinetic energy, represented by:
$$
KE=\int_{r_i}^{r_f} \vec{E}q \cdot dr = V_f - V_i
$$
The electric charge of an object may also be represented by the charge per unit region of space, whether it be per unit area, volume, or length. Right?

| Name | Unit | Equation |
| ——— | ——— | ——— | 
| Linear charge density | Charge per unit length | $\lambda = \frac{q}{l}$ |
| Surface charge density | Charge per unit area | $\sigma = \frac{q}{A}$ |
| Volume charge density | Charge per unit volume | $\rho = \frac{q}{v}$ |
