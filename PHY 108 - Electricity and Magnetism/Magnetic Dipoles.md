In a magnet, there are two ends where the [[magnetic field]] lines enter and exit. The north pole is the side from which the field lines emerge, while the end where field lines enter is the south pole. 

When a [[Electric Current]] runs through a loop of wire or a coil, it too becomes a magnetic dipole, because the current goes in two different dimensions. This means that when put in a magnetic field, a torque will be exerted on the loop of wire. To find this torque, we give this coil a magnetic moment, whose magnitude is given by the current, the area of the wire A, and the number of turns in the coil:

$$
\mu = NiA
$$

With this value, we can find the torque by using the following equation:

$$
\tau = \mu B \sin \theta
$$
