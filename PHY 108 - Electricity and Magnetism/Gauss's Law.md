Gauss's Law states that for any given closed surface, the [[electric flux]] is equal to the enclosed [[electric charge]] divided by the permittivity of free space, as shown here:

$$
\Phi = \oint_S \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{q_{enclosed}}{\epsilon_0}
$$

This law implies that for any given Gaussian (closed) surface, the [[electric field]] going through its surface is only dependent on the charge inside the surface. This means that if you know that the electric field should be the same everywhere on the surface (especially in the case of symmetry, such as infinite planes or spheres) $\vec{E}$ can be taken out of the integral and be solved for.

$$
\Phi = \vec{E} \oint_S d\vec{A} \Rightarrow \vec{E} \cdot \vec{A} = \frac{q_{enclosed}}{\epsilon_0}
$$
