Inductance is the tendency of an electrical conductor to oppose a change in the electric current flowing through it. A change of magnetic flux will cause a current in a wire to start, opposing the magnetic flux, according to [Faraday's Law of Induction](Faraday's%20Law%20of%20Induction.md). If a [circuit](Circuits.md) had a coil attached, a [Magnetic Field](magnetic%20field.md) would form through the coil, meaning that there would be an induced emf through the coil opposing the battery's emf. 

The induced magnetic flux from some amount of current is called the inductance, or as it is formally defined, the magnetic flux of all loops in a coil per amp of current.

L= \frac{N\Phi_B}{i}

From Faraday's law, we may also find the opposing emf of a coil in a circuit, or the self-induction, from the inductance and change in current.



Self-inductance may be interpreted as the electrical analog to the mass of an object, as both values will cause the
