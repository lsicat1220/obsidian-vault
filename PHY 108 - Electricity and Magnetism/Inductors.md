Inductors are devices in a [[Circuits|circuit]] that stores energy in a [[magnetic field]]. It is generally made of a coil of N turns. When a magnetic field is created, it is said that the windings of the inductor are linked by the shared flux, or the product of the number of turns times the magnetic flux. This product is called the magnetic flux linkage.
