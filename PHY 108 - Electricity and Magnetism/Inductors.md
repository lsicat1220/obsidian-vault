Inductors are devices in a [circuit](Circuits.md) that stores energy in a [Magnetic Field](magnetic%20field.md). It is most commonly a [solenoid](Solenoids.md) of N turns and works to oppose the change of a current. 

The inductance of an inductor is determined only by its geometry. For example, a solenoid has a magnetic field anywhere inside the coils ($B = \mu_0in$), so given n, the numbers of turns per unit length, we may write:

$$
L= \frac{(nl)(BA)}{i}=\frac{(nl)(\mu_0 in)(A)}{i}=\mu_0n^2lA
$$
