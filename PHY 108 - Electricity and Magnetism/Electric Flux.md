Electric flux is the total [[electric field]] crossing a given surface. It can be found by using this formula:

$$
\Phi = \int_S\vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A}
$$
This equation only counts for the components of the electric field vectors that are perpendicular to a given point on a surface. This means that if an electric field is perfectly parallel to the surface, there is no electric flux.


To distinguish between flux of an open surface and one that's completely closed, a closed surface integral is used, as seen here:

$$
\Phi = \oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A}
$$
