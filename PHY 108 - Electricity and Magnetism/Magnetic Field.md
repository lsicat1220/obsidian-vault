The formula for finding the force on a moving particle by a magnetic field is 

$$
\vec{F}=q \vec{v} \times \vec{B} = q\vec{v}\vec{B}sin(\theta)
$$

where $\vec{B}$ is the vector of the magnetic field, given in newtons per coulomb-meter per second, or a tesla (T). The magnetic field may also be given in gauss, which is $10^4T$. The direction of the magnetic force can be remembered with the right hand rule, where the pointer is the velocity, the middle finger is the magnetic field, and the thumb is the force.


If the magnetic field is perpendicular to the charge's movement (such as in the case of a charge moving across the screen with a magnetic field going through the screen) the equation may be simplified to 

$$
\vec{F}=q\vec{v}\vec{B}
$$


When a particle is moving in a magnetic field that is being opposed by an [Electric Field](electric%20field.md), the two fields are only canceled when the following equation is met:

$$
v=\frac{E}{B}
$$

Since [current](Electric%20Current.md) is defined as the amount of charge going through a cross sectional area of the wire at a time, we can multiply that by any given length to find the moving charge in an area and use that value to find the magnetic force on a wire.

$$
\vec{F_b}=i\vec{L} \times \vec{B}
$$
