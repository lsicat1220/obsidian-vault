The formula for finding the force on a moving particle by a magnetic field is 

$$
\vec{F}=q \vec{v} \times \vec{B} = q\vec{v}\vec{B}sin(\theta)
$$

where $\vec{B}$ is the vector of the magnetic field, given in newtons per coulomb-meter per second, or a tesla (T). The magnetic field may also be given in gauss, which is $10^4T$. 


If the magnetic field is perpendicular to the charge's movement (such as in the case of a charge moving across the screen with a magnetic field going through the screen) the equation may be simplified to 

$$
\vec{F}=q\vec{v}\vec{B}
$$


When a particle is moving in a magnetic field that is being opposed by an [[electric field]], the two fields are only canceled when the following equation is met:

$$
v=\frac{E}{B}
$$

When a conductor moves through a uniform magnetic field, the free-moving electrons will have a force exerted on it, since it is moving. The end result is that electrons will be pulled to one side of the conductor, giving it a potential difference across the perpendicular length of the field, given by 

$$
V=vBd
$$
