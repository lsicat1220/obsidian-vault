A capacitor is a device in a circuit that stores electric energy by storing opposite [[electric charge|electric charges]] on two closely spaced surfaces. The charge it can store is determined by its capacitance (ability to hold charge) and the [[electric potential|voltage]] of the battery it's connected to:

q=CV

The unit for capacitance is the farad (F) which is one coulomb per one volt.
