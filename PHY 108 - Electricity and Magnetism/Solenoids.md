Solenoids are tightly wound helical coils of wire in which a [[magnetic field]] can flow  in one direction through the coil. 

An ideal solenoid is one where the the magnetic field is uniform inside it and zero outside it. When analyzing a solenoid like this, you can use [[Ampere's Law]] to find the magnetic field with a rectangle with one side inside the solenoid and parallel to the magnetic field.

$$
\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{s} = \mu_0 i_{enc} \Rightarrow Bh = \mu_0 inh \Rightarrow B = \mu_0 in
$$
where n is the number of turns per unit length.
