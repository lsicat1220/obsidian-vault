When electrons flow through a [[Conductors|conductor]], the speed at which they do so is limited, because while they get accelerated by the [[electric field]], the electrons will inevitably collide with the protons, leading their speed to be reset until they accelerate back. 

The average speed at which an electron will drift through the conductor is known as the drift velocity, denoted by $v_d$. This value can be found by multiplying the acceleration (the electrostatic force on an electron divided by the mass) times the average time between collisions $\tau$. 

$$
v_d = \frac{eE}{m_e} \cdot \tau
$$
For any electric field, the speed of electrons largely depends on the material of the conductor. For normal temperatures, this is a constant $\sigma$, known as conductivity. Using this, while also accounting for the area and length of the conductor, we get the resistance of the conductor when used in a [[Circuits|circuit]]. 

$$
R= \frac{\sigma L}{A}
$$
