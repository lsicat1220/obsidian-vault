When electrons flow through a [[Conductors|conductor]], the speed at which they do so is limited, because while they get accelerated by the [[electric field]], the electrons will inevitably collide with the protons, leading their speed to be reset until they accelerate back. 

The average speed at which an electron will drift through the conductor is known as the drift velocity, denoted by $v_d$. This value can be found by multiplying the acceleration (the electrostatic force on an electron divided by the mass) times the average time between collisions $\tau$. 

$$
v_d = \frac{eE}{m_e} \cdot \tau
