Capacitance is the amount of charge that can be stored in an electrical device, most commonly [[capacitors]]. The unit for capacitance is the farad (F) which is one coulomb per volt. Because this unit is large, it is often given in the form of micro or picofarads. 

$$
q=CV \Rightarrow C=\frac{q}{V}
$$

The capacitance of a capacitor depends only on its geometry. Most capacitors are symmetrical, so [[Gauss's Law]] can be used to find the [[Electric Field]] in terms of q, which then can be used in the equation for voltage to solve for q/V.
