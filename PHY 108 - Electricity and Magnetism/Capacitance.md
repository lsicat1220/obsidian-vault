Capacitance is the amount of [[Electric Charge|charge]] that can be stored in an electrical device, most commonly [[capacitors]]. The unit for capacitance is the farad (F) which is one coulomb per volt. Because this unit is large, it is often given in the form of micro or picofarads. 

$$
q=CV \Rightarrow C=\frac{q}{V}
$$

The capacitance of a capacitor depends only on its geometry. Most capacitors are symmetrical, so [[Gauss's Law]] can be used to find the [[Electric Potential|voltage]] in terms of q, which then can be used in the equation for voltage to solve for q/V. For example, the electric field of two parallel plates is constant everywhere between the plates, being $\sigma/2\epsilon_0$. Plugging that into the previous equation gives:

$$
C=\frac{\epsilon_0A}{d}
$$

The capacitance of multiple connected capacitors changes depends on whether they are put in series or parallel. When the capacitors are in parallel, the overall capacitance of all the capacitors (equivalent capacitance) is the sum of each of their individual values, as if it was one capacitor with the area increased. 

$$
C_{total} = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + ...
$$

When the capacitors are in series, the total capacitance will be less than the any of the individual values, as if it was one capacitor with the distance increased. 

$$
\frac{1}{C_{total}}= \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \frac{1}{C_3} + ...
$$
