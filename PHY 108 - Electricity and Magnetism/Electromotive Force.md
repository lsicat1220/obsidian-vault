Electromotive force, or emf, is the work per unit charge done by some force inside a [[Conductors|conductor]]. Essentially, it is the full energy conversion of electrical energy from another type of energy, such as chemical energy in a battery, and is the underlying causes of [[Electric Potential|voltage]] differences in a [[Circuits|circuit]]. We denote this quantity with the symbol $\xi$.

In an ideal battery, the voltage difference that it applies across the circuit would be equal to the emf, but in reality the battery has an internal [[resistance]] due to the chemical reactions happening to allow for current to flow and to create the voltage difference in the first place. Therefore, the true voltage of the battery is the emf minus the internal resistance.
