#1: An object at rest or at motion must stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force.

#2: The net [[force]] done on an object is the rate at which momentum changes over time, or:
$$
\vec{F}_{net}=\frac{dp}{dt}
$$
This means that an object will only move if there is a prevailing force in a direction that is greater than forces in the other direction. Given an unchanging mass, the change in momentum is equivalent to the change in velocity, so this equates to the following equation:
$$
F_{net}=ma
$$
#3: For every action, there must be an equal and opposite reaction. For example, if you push on a wall, the wall will push back with the same force.
